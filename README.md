# DRISHYA

## Overview
DRISHYA is a React-based application designed to enhance user interaction and engagement through visual storytelling. It aims to provide a platform for users to create, share, and explore content in a visually appealing way.

It is a project aimed at enhancing and reconstructing facial features from low-quality images, such as those from CCTV footage, using advanced machine learning techniques. The focus is on improving the clarity of faces in challenging conditions, such as low light, motion blur, and occlusion. By applying techniques like **super-resolution**, **noise reduction**, and **deblurring**, DRISHYA seeks to refine facial details in poor-quality images.

Key goals include:

- **Facial Reconstruction**: Rebuilding facial features from degraded or pixelated images.
- **Super-Resolution**: Enhancing the resolution of images to recover finer details.
- **Noise Reduction & Deblurring**: Reducing noise and blurring to improve image clarity.
  
Future developments include incorporating **3D reconstruction** and **facial recognition**, as well as exploring real-time video processing for live footage enhancement. DRISHYA is designed for applications in security, surveillance, and other areas where facial identification from suboptimal sources is critical.
